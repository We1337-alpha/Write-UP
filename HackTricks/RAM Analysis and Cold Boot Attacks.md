RAM retains data briefly after power is cut, usually for **1 to 2 minutes**. This persistence can be extended to **10 minutes** by applying cold substances, such as liquid nitrogen. During this extended period, a **memory dump** can be created using tools like **dd.exe** and **volatility** for analysis.
