**Resetting the BIOS** can be achieved in several ways. Most motherboards include a **battery** that, when removed for around **30 minutes**, will reset the BIOS settings, including the password. Alternatively, a **jumper on the motherboard** can be adjusted to reset these settings by connecting specific pins.

For situations where hardware adjustments are not possible or practical, **software tools** offer a solution. Running a system from a **Live CD/USB** with distributions like **Kali Linux** provides access to tools like _**killCmos**_ and _**CmosPWD**_, which can assist in BIOS password recovery.

In cases where the BIOS password is unknown, entering it incorrectly **three times** will typically result in an error code. This code can be used on websites like [https://bios-pw.org](https://bios-pw.org/) to potentially retrieve a usable password.
